Description: An R API providing access to a relational database with macroeconomic data for Africa. 
             The database contains >700 macroeconomic time series from mostly international sources, 
             grouped into 50 macroeconomic and development-related topics. Series are carefully selected
             on the basis of data coverage for Africa, frequency, and relevance to the macro-development context. 
             The project is part of the 'Kiel Institute Africa Initiative' 
             <https://www.ifw-kiel.de/institute/initiatives/kielinstituteafricainitiative/>, 
             which, amongst other things, aims to develop a parsimonious database with highly relevant indicators 
             to monitor macroeconomic developments in Africa, accessible through a fast API and a web-based platform
             at <https://africamonitor.ifw-kiel.de/>. 
             The database is maintained at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy <https://www.ifw-kiel.de/>.
